# CoMaL: Conditional Maximum Likelihood Approach to Self-supervised Domain Adaptation in Long-tail Semantic Segmentation


## Introduction

This is an extended version of our [BiMaL](https://github.com/uark-cviu/BiMaL) to address the long-tail semantic segmentation problem in the domain adaptation setting.

## Implementation

The implementation will be available soon.
